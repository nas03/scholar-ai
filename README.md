# ScholarAI - Smart Academic Management Platform

## Project Overview

ScholarAI is an intelligent academic management system designed for university students to organize their courses, manage study materials, track academic performance, and leverage AI to enhance their learning. Unlike traditional LMS platforms (which are for instructors), ScholarAI is student-centric, helping them take control of their academic journey with features like automatic note summarization, AI-generated quizzes, GPA tracking, and smart study reminders.

## Why This Project?

**Real-world Problem:**
- Students use scattered tools (Google Drive for notes, phone calendar for reminders, Excel for GPA tracking)
- Lecture notes are often too long and unstructured for efficient studying
- Students don't practice enough before exams due to lack of quality practice materials
- No unified system to track academic performance across semesters
- Students struggle to prioritize study time across multiple courses

**Monetization Strategy:**
- Freemium: 3 courses, basic features, 10 AI operations/month
- Student tier: $6.99/month for unlimited courses, unlimited AI features
- Premium tier: $12.99/month with group study rooms, advanced analytics, export features
- University partnerships: $2/student/year for campus-wide licenses
- Affiliate revenue from study material marketplaces
- Premium AI models (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5) for better summarization

**Scalability:**
- Multi-tenant architecture supporting millions of students
- File storage on S3 with CloudFront CDN
- Background job processing for AI operations (summarization, quiz generation)
- Horizontal scaling for API endpoints
- Database partitioning by academic year/semester

## Key Technical Decisions

### Architecture Principles (SOLID)

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
   - Each module handles one domain (courses, notes, AI, GPA)
   - Service classes have focused responsibilities
   - Example: `NoteSummarizationService` only handles summarization, not quiz generation

2. **Open/Closed Principle**
   - Use strategy pattern for different AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, local models)
   - Abstract grading scale calculations for different systems
   - Plugin architecture for future integrations

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle**
   - All AI service implementations follow the same interface
   - File storage adapters (S3, Cloudflare R2) are interchangeable

4. **Interface Segregation Principle**
   - Separate interfaces for different AI capabilities
   - Don't force clients to depend on unused methods

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**
   - Depend on abstractions (interfaces) not concrete implementations
   - Use dependency injection throughout Nest.js

### Code Quality Standards

```typescript
// Example: Clean service with dependency injection

interface AIProvider {
  summarize(text: string): Promise<string>;
  generateQuiz(text: string, count: number): Promise<Quiz>;
}

@Injectable()
export class OpenAIProvider implements AIProvider {
  constructor(
    private readonly configService: ConfigService,
    private readonly httpService: HttpService,
  ) {}

  async summarize(text: string): Promise<string> {
    // Implementation
  }

  async generateQuiz(text: string, count: number): Promise<Quiz> {
    // Implementation
  }
}

@Injectable()
export class NoteSummarizationService {
  constructor(
    @Inject('AI_PROVIDER') private readonly aiProvider: AIProvider,
    private readonly usageService: AIUsageService,
    private readonly notesRepository: NotesRepository,
  ) {}

  async summarizeNote(noteId: string, userId: string): Promise<Summary> {
    // Check rate limits
    await this.usageService.checkAndIncrementUsage(userId);
    
    // Get note
    const note = await this.notesRepository.findOne(noteId, userId);
    
    // Summarize
    const summary = await this.aiProvider.summarize(note.content);
    
    // Save and return
    return this.saveSummary(noteId, summary);
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations

- [ ] Input validation with class-validator and Zod
- [ ] Rate limiting on AI endpoints (prevent abuse)
- [ ] File upload validation (size, type, virus scanning)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (Prisma parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitize rich text content)
- [ ] CSRF tokens for sensitive operations
- [ ] JWT token rotation and refresh strategy
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Audit logging for data modifications
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- [ ] Secure file storage with signed URLs
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP) headers

### Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement Redis caching for:
  - User sessions
  - Frequently accessed courses
  - Timetable data
  - GPA calculations
- [ ] Database indexing on:
  - User IDs
  - Course IDs
  - Semester/year combinations
  - Search fields (note titles, tags)
- [ ] Lazy loading for notes and files
- [ ] Pagination for lists (courses, notes, assignments)
- [ ] Background processing for AI operations
- [ ] CDN for static assets and uploaded files
- [ ] Database query optimization with Prisma
- [ ] Bundle splitting and code splitting in Next.js

## AI Features Deep Dive

### 1. Note Summarization

**Input:** Rich text or uploaded document  
**Process:**
1. Extract text content
2. Chunk text if too long (>4000 tokens)
3. Send to AI API with prompt: "Summarize the following lecture notes, focusing on key concepts, definitions, and important points."
4. Return formatted summary with bullet points

**Prompt Engineering:**
```typescript
const SUMMARIZATION_PROMPT = `
You are an expert academic tutor. Summarize the following lecture notes for a student.

Requirements:
- Extract 5-10 key concepts
- Include important definitions
- Highlight critical formulas or theorems
- Use clear bullet points
- Keep it concise (max 300 words)

Lecture Notes:
{content}
`;
```

### 2. Quiz Generation

**Input:** Note content + desired question count + difficulty  
**Output:** Array of questions with answers

**Question Types:**
- Multiple choice (4 options)
- True/False
- Short answer
- Fill in the blank

**Prompt Engineering:**
```typescript
const QUIZ_GENERATION_PROMPT = `
Generate {count} {difficulty} level quiz questions based on these lecture notes.

Format as JSON:
[
  {
    "type": "multiple_choice",
    "question": "...",
    "options": ["A", "B", "C", "D"],
    "correct": "B",
    "explanation": "..."
  }
]

Notes:
{content}
`;
```

### 3. Chat with Notes (RAG)

**Architecture:**
1. When notes are created/updated, generate embeddings
2. Store embeddings in vector database
3. When user asks question:
   - Generate query embedding
   - Find similar note chunks (k=5)
   - Send context + question to AI
   - Return answer with source citations

**Tech Stack:**
- Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small
- Vector DB: Pinecone or Weaviate
- Retrieval: Cosine similarity search

### 4. Smart Study Planner

**Algorithm:**
1. Get all upcoming exams and assignments
2. Calculate available study time
3. Consider factors:
   - Days until deadline
   - Course difficulty (user-rated)
   - Current grade in course
   - Amount of material to cover
4. Generate daily study schedule using weighted algorithm
5. Apply spaced repetition principles
